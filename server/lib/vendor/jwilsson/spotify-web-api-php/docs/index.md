There are two ways to install `spotify-web-api-php`. The "classic way" or the [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) way.

### "Classic way"
The "classic" way to install `spotify-web-api-php` is to simply download the latest version and include the required files.
It's highly recommend to use [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) or at least a [autoloader](http://php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.autoload.php).

### Composer way
The second way is by using [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) and adding `spotify-web-api-php` as a dependency.

    "require": {
        "jwilsson/spotify-web-api-php": "^1.0.0"
    }

Now, take a look at the [Authorization steps](authorization.html), the [Method Reference]({{ site.baseurl }}/method-reference/), and some [examples]({{ site.baseurl }}/examples/).
