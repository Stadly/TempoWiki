Welcome to TempoWiki for Spotify!

How to install and set up TempoWiki:
1. Go to https://devaccount.spotify.com/my-account and sign up for a developer account
2. Create the folder ~/Spotify (Mac OS X and Linux) or My Documents\Spotify (Windows)
3. Copy the folder containing this file into the folder you just created
4. Restart Spotify. There should be a new menu entry "Develop". If it's not there, wait a bit and restart Spotify again.
5. With Spotify showing the "Develop" menu entry, type "spotify:app:tw" in the search bar
6. You have now started TempoWiki. Go to the Profile creator-tab and configure your first profile. A profile is used for filtering which properties and attributes you are interested in when looking for a specific type of music. If you're into Lindy Hop, you can for example call the profile "Lindy Hop", and check the dance genre Lindy Hop, the music genres Blues, Dixieland, Swing Jazz, and Big Band, along with the tempo unit Bar. You can create multiple profiles, and configure them exactly as you want.
7. After you have created one or more profiles, go to the Playlist creator-tab to generate your first playlist. Click the musical attributes that you are looking for to check them. For example the dance genre Lindy Hop, and the music genres Dixieland and Swing Jazz. A playlist matching the checked criteria will be created. Music that matches other attributes than those checked may also be listed. For example if a track is both Swing Jazz and Big Band, it will be shown when any of these attributes is checked. If you are not interested in Big Band music, click this attribute twice (so that it becomes red). Now tracks that match Big Band is filtered from the list. The tempo range that you are interested in can be defined using the tempo slider (it currently looks like a scrollbar). You can sort the generated playlist by clicking on the header for the property that you would like to sort by. Not all properties are sortable.
8. Go to the Now playing-tab. Here information about the currently playing track is shown. You can alter the information that is registered, or add information to tracks that are not yet registered in the database. A track can not appear in playlists before information has been added to a it, so it's a good idea to add information to your favourite tracks.

Congratulations! You have not successfully installed and tried out the most important features of TempoWiki.

There are a few other things that might be good to know about:
1. Every time you restart Spotify, TempoWiki will disappear from the App menu, and you'll have to type "spotify:app:tw" in the search bar to start TempoWiki.
2. If you encounter a track in a playlist where you think it does not belong,  (for example if you regard a track as only Swing Jazz and Dixieland, but it appears in a Big Band list), you can enter the editor (Now playling -> Edit while the track is playing) and click twice on Big Band (so it becomes red). This means that you would not like to see this track in your Big Band lists, even though other users regard this track as Big Band.
3. Due to a bug in Spotify it is not always possible to view and register information about tracks in the Now playing-tab. On Windows and Mac OS X this happens when the track is queued from a search result, and on Linux it seems that it is never possible to view and register information about tracks.

Thank you for testing and using TempoWiki! If you have any questions, requests for new genres, or ideas for further development, please don't hesitate contacting me at magnar@myrtveit.com.
